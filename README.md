# Peddler

![Peddler][1]

**Peddler** is a full-featured Ruby interface to the [Amazon Marketplace Web
Service (MWS) APIs][2].

## Usage

Require the library:

```ruby
require 'peddler'
```

Alternatively, require a particular API only:

```ruby
require 'mws/orders'
```

Instantiate a client with the ISO 3166-1 two-letter country code of the
marketplace and your seller credentials:

```ruby
client = MWS::Orders::Client.new('GB', 'key', 'secret', 'merchant_id')
```

Alternatively, set your credentials as environment variables in your shell:

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret
export MERCHANT_ID=merchant_id
```

Then, instantiate with the country code:

```ruby
client = MWS::Orders::Client.new('US')
```

When developing, set the `EXCON_DEBUG` environment variable to debug the HTTP
exchange.

### Feeds

The MWS Feeds API lets you upload inventory and order data to Amazon. You can
also use this API to get information about the processing of feeds.

[API methods are available on the client][3].

Instantiate a client:

```ruby
client = MWS::Feeds::Client.new('GB')
```

#### Submit Feed

Submit a feed:

```ruby
client.submit_feed(xml, '_POST_PRODUCT_DATA_')
```

#### Feed Submission List

List past feed submissions:

```ruby
# See the API for all available parameters for this and other methods.
client.get_feed_submissions
```

List the next page of feed submissions:

```ruby
client.get_feed_submissions_by_next_token
```

You can optionally specify a token:

```ruby
res = client.get_feed_submissions
client.get_feed_submissions_by_next_token(res.next_token)
```

#### Feed Submission Count

Get the feed submission count:

```ruby
client.get_feed_submission_count(submitted_from_date: 1.day.ago)
```

#### Feed Submission Result

Get the processing report for a submitted feed:

```ruby
client.feed_submission_result('123456')
```

#### Feed Submissions

Cancel one or more feed submissions:

```ruby
client.cancel_feed_submissions(submitted_to_date: 1.day.ago)
```

```

```

Get one or more orders based on their order numbers:

```ruby

```

All above queries will return an enumerable list of orders.

```ruby
client.list_order_items('123-1234567-1234567')
```

List the next page of order items:
