**Peddler** is a Ruby interface to the [Amazon MWS API](https://developer.amazonservices.com/), a collection of web services that help Amazon sellers programmatically exchange data on their listings, orders, payments, reports, and more.

To use Amazon MWS, you must have an eligible seller account.

## Configuration

Require the library and instantiate a client.

```ruby
require 'peddler'
client = MWS.orders
```

You can set up credentials when instantiating:

```ruby
client = MWS.orders(
  marketplace_id: 'A1F83G8C2ARO7P',
  merchant_id: 'A2A9WNXCU02UZW',
  aws_access_key_id: 'AKIVICHZMZ2JRSSLC27W',
  aws_secret_access_key: 'rOMa3ydPBTJ3AD0bxERTOX0Fv0fAC6Q0s6/czMZO'
)

Or you can set them via `Client#configure`.

```ruby
client.configure do |c|
  c.marketplace_id = 'A1F83G8C2ARO7P'
  c.merchant_id = 'A2A9WNXCU02UZW'
  c.aws_access_key_id = 'AKIVICHZMZ2JRSSLC27W'
  c.aws_secret_access_key = 'rOMa3ydPBTJ3AD0bxERTOX0Fv0fAC6Q0s6/czMZO'
end
```

Or you may use environment variables if you have only a single set of credentials:

```sh
export MWS_MARKETPLACE_ID="A1F83G8C2ARO7P"
export MWS_MERCHANT_ID="A2A9WNXCU02UZW"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIVICHZMZ2JRSSLC27W"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="rOMa3ydPBTJ3AD0bxERTOX0Fv0fAC6Q0s6/czMZO"
```

### Fulfillment Outbound Shipment

**Partially implemented**

The MWS Fulfillment Outbound Shipment API enables you to fulfill orders placed through channels other than Amazon's retail web site, using your inventory in the Amazon Fulfillment Network. You can request previews of potential fulfillment orders that return estimated shipping fees and shipping dates based on shipping speed. You can get detailed item-level, shipment-level, and order-level information for any existing fulfillment order that you specify. You can also request lists of existing fulfillment orders based on when they were fulfilled and by the fulfillment method associated with them.

Support for creating and cancelling fulfillment orders has been implemented, but the rest of the API is not supported yet.
