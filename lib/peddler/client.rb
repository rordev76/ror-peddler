# = Peddler
# The affectionately-named Peddler is a Ruby wrapper to the Amazon Inventory management API. It supports all the functionality, new and old, provided by the API.
# 
# Peddler::Client has some detailed explanation and examples of usage.
module Peddler
  # This is the public interface of the Peddler library.
  class Client
    # Creates a client instance.
    #
    #    client = Peddler::Client.new :username => "foo@bar.com",
    #                                 :password => "secret",

    #     report = client.new_report :upload, :id => batch.id
    #     report.body
    #
    # That should output something like the following, assuming everything went well with the upload:
