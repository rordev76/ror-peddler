    # The Merchant Fulfillment API provides programmatic access to Amazon's
    # Shipping Services for sellers, including competitive rates from
    # Amazon-partnered carriers. Sellers can find out what shipping service
    # offers are available by submitting information about a proposed shipment,
    # such as package size and weight, shipment origin, and delivery date
    # requirements. Sellers can choose from the shipping service offers returned
    # by Amazon, and then purchase shipping labels for fulfilling their orders.
